# To dos

Here I will list all the to dos and design decisions I do.


### Vue Component Libraries

First, I used VuePrime, I'm not liking it, so instead I'm thinking of using something like Bulma or bootstrap. Will check which other 
component libraries are available for Vue.

- Quasar 
- Bootstrap Vue 

These two are like the most common component libraries, but I do not like their designs. Bootstrap just looks old and Quasar style just does not stick with me.
